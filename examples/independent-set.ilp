maximize:
    x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 + x5 + x6
subject to:
    x1 + x2 <= 1
    x2 + x3 <= 1
    x3 + x4 <= 1
    x1 + x5 <= 1
    x2 + x5 <= 1
    x3 + x6 <= 1
    x5 + x6 <= 1
notes:
We are looking for the maximum independent set in the following graph:

1 -- 2 -- 3 -- 4
  \  |    |
   \ |    |
     5 -- 6

Solution: {2,4,6}

x_i indicates whether i is in the independent set.
For each edge we have to add a constraint:
At most one endpoint can be in the set.
