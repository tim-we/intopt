minimize:
    x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 + x5
subject to:
    -7*x1 + -3*x2 + -2*x3 + 5*x4 + 8*x5 = 0
    x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 + x5 >= 1
    x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 + x5 <= 5
notes:
Is there a (non-empty) subset of {-7, -3, -2, 5, 8} that sums to 0?
Solution: {-3,-2, 5}
x_i indicates whether the number is in the subset or not.
Warning: x_i <= 1 constraints were omitted.
Thus a solution of this ILP is not necessarily a solution to the subset sum problem.
