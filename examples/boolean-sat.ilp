minimize:
    x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 + x5 + x6
subject to:
    x1 + 1 + -x2 + x3 >= 1
    x3 + x4 + x5 >= 1
    x1 + x6 >= 1
    1 + -x5 + 1 + -x6 >= 1  
    1 + -x6 >= 1
notes:
Boolean SAT:

    ( x1 or !x2 or x3) 
and ( x3 or  x4 or x5)
and ( x1 or  x6)
and (!x5 or !x6)
and (!x6)

If the solver finds any xi > 1 we would have to add additional constraints (xi <= 1)
